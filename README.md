Attempted to begin writing PyBank a few times, ran into filenotfound errors

12-14-20 Attempted to debug PyBank filenotfounderror
Got help from Learning Assistant. They could not remedy filenotfound. However, they rewrote my program and told me to use theirs

12-15-20 Sat down to debug indentation in program given to me by learning assistant
Removed all indentation errors
Realized the entire time that running the program from VSCode was causing the file not found problem
Ran PyBank in GitBash to find new errors to debug, but no more FNF!
